## :scroll: About
A live markdown editor to create nice looking `.md` files.  
The project was created with [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/). Written in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), it uses [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) as state manager. To parse/render the markdown it uses [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) with [emoji-js](https://github.com/iamcal/js-emoji).

You can switch the rendered HTML's style between:
- [GitHub Markdown Style](https://primer.style/css/components/markdown)
- Bitbucket Markdown Style
